I chose 3 countries – Namibia, Angola and Kenya. 
I found the total death rate of Namibia during 2001 by clicking the year and viewing the data.
Namibia’s total death rate was 1,728.
I found that Angola’s death toll dropped under the country’s average of 11,469 deaths during 2007.
Angola had about 10,000 deaths that year.
I found this information by clicking the year and comparing Angola’s total death rate to the total death rate of Africa.
I found Kenya’s highest death toll rate was in 2003 totaling to over 50k compared to Africa’s average of 25k.
You can find this information by hovering over the years and selecting the line for the average.
